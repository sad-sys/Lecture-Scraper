HTML Parser for Course Modules


This project consists of a Python script designed to parse HTML files, specifically targeting course module information. It extracts titles from <a> tags with a specific class attribute and presents them in a readable format. This can be particularly useful for educational institutions, researchers, or students looking to organize and access course content efficiently.
